In today's lecture, we will simply get in touch with JavaScript, and learn how to set up the development
environment. Finally, we will learn how to start our JS project through a simple code.

What is JavaScript?
Javacript is one of the most popular and wildely used programming language in the wolrd right now. 
It's growing faster than any other parogramming languages. You can work as a front-end developer
back-end developer or a full stack developer.

What can you do with it?
For a long time, JavaScript was only used in browsers to build interective web pages. Now you can 
build web or mobile apps as well as real time networking application such as chats and video streaming services,
command line tools or even games. 

Where does JavaScript code run?
JavaScript was orginally designed only in browsers, so every browser has what we a called JavaScript engine that 
can execute JS code. For example, the JS engines in Firefox and Chrome are SpiderMonkey and v8.

Every browser has a JS engine and we can easily write JS code without any additional tools. Of course, it is not
how we build real world applications. It is just a quick demo.

So, open a browser such as chrome and right click on an empty area and go to inspect. Then we are at the chrome develope
tools. Select the console tab. This is the JS console, and we can write any valid JS code here. 

You can type this: console.log('Hello World.')
(console dot log, put a single quote here and then type Hello World. Put another quote, then add a semicolon at the end.)

Now, press enter and you can see the Hello World message in the console. 

We can also write mathematic expressions here. Like we type 6*9, then enter, the result will also appear in the console.

Or we can do something like this,let us type alert('What's up!'), enter, then as you can see, here pops up a windows with 
What's up!

We then learn how to set up the development environment. In order to formally write a JS code, you need a code editor. There
are varius code editors out there, including Visual Studio Code, or say VS Code, Sublime Text and so on. Let us use vs code
to edit JS code in this course. After you are familiar with JS programming. You can turn to other editors as you like.
